libva-h264 is a set of building blocks for making H.264 decoding
applications.  libva-h264 is not a decoder or media framework
itself, but can be used to build decoders and media frameworks.

This library is made to be used with the libva API. Data structure
and interface design was done with an eye for convenient,
ergonomic use in libva applications.
